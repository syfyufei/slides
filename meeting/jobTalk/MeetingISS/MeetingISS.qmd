# Visiting Research Proposal

## Research Proposal{.small}

- Title: Parroting for What：The Differential Diffusion of Political Discourse -- Evidence from Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR

- Abstract: 

  - When a political entity engages in discursive practices, it is influenced by the pre-existing narratives of other political entities, a phenomenon termed as political discourse diffusion. The Central Government of China has established a systematic and distinctively styled official discourse framework. The incorporation of this official discourse into political praxis remains under-explored. Questions regarding how other political entities comprehend, interpret, utilize, and propagate the official discourse are yet to be systematically addressed in the scholarly discourse. This research endeavors to analyze the influence of the Central Government of China's official discourse on the discourse of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, through the development of the Hong Kong Political Discourse Dataset (HKPDD). It employs a mixed-methods approach to scrutinize the adoption of central discourse across the spectrum of the Hong Kong political-administrative hierarchy. Furthermore, this study seeks to elucidate the ramifications of central discourse on the legitimacy and efficacy of the Hong Kong government, predicated on an examination of the diffusion mechanisms of central discourse within the governmental apparatus of Hong Kong.
