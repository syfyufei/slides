  abstract = {This article examines the relationships among task goal clarity, task significance, and individual-level task performance. While both goals and task significance are important in extant public-management research, a theoretical integration of the variables is needed. This study makes the theoretical contribution of explaining how these variables might work together in a public organization. In addition to examining the relationship between task goal clarity and performance, we consider how task significance might condition the relationship. There are theoretical reasons to suggest both a positive and negative conditional effect. Utilizing a 3\texttimes 2 factorial design, we conducted a laboratory experiment on 214 subjects participating in a task-performance exercise. This study provides experimental evidence that task goal clarity is positively related to performance. However, an interesting relationship emerges with respect to the conditional effect of task significance. When an individual is primed to believe their performance has a higher level of task significance, the evidence suggests that this will decrease their level of performance. The findings provide significant nuance to our understanding of both task goal clarity and performance, as well as our understanding of the relationship between task significance and performance.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a framework integrating theoretical insights, empirical research and practical advice emerging from public service motivation (PSM) and self-determination theory (SDT). It aims at demonstrating that, while PSM shows the relevance of public values for motivation, SDT explains how context affects it. Taking the two theoretical approaches as complementary to one another and by pointing out their ``static'' and ``dynamic'' features, the framework provides a theoretical foundation for organizational practices aimed at enhancing motivation in the public services. Design/methodology/approach The framework is based on a review of PSM and SDT theoretical concepts and empirical studies; the analysis examines the implications and contributions of each approach to the understanding of motivation in the public services. Findings The paper demonstrates that PSM and SDT are complementary theoretical approaches and that this complementarity can provide clearer guidance to practitioners and widen the understanding of motivation in the public services. Research limitations/implications The framework considers only a few features pertaining motivation in the public services, such as public values, basic needs satisfaction, prosocial behaviour and socialization. Further research should explore additional factors. Practical implications The framework provides an explanation of why some practices are likely to enhance motivation in the public services, while others are likely to deplete it. Originality/value The framework does not limit itself to proposing the theoretical integration of PSM and SDT, but connects this integration to organizational practices.},

Aiming to increase the importance attributed to benevolence values, which reflect the motivation to help and care for others, the intervention combines three mechanisms for value change (self-persuasion, consistency-maintenance, and priming). In three experiments, 142 undergraduates (67\% male, ages 19\textendash 26) participated in an intervention emphasizing the importance of either helping others (benevolence condition) or recognizing flexibility in personality (control condition). We measured the importance of benevolence values before and after the task. In Experiment 1, the intervention increased U.S. participants' benevolence values. In Experiment 2, we replicated these effects in a different culture (Israel) and also showed that by enhancing benevolence values, the intervention increased participants' willingness to volunteer to help others. Experiment 3 showed that the increases in the importance of benevolence values lasted at least 4 weeks. Our results provide evidence that value change does not require fictitious feedback or information about social norms, but can occur through a 30-min intervention that evokes both effortful and automatic processes.},

As the principal must compensate workers for their monitoring efforts and the costs that peer pressure imposes on workers, introducing peer pressure alters the optimal compensation package. We establish conditions under which the principal reduces the marginal compensation rule to reduce monitoring efforts. As such, peer pressure provides a rationale for a reduced link between compensation and output in a team setting.}

Results indicate that Ss perceived less peer pressure toward misconduct than peer involvement and also were comparatively less willing to follow peers in misconduct. Nevertheless, perceived peer pressure and conformity disposition accounted for more of the variance in self-reported misconduct than in self-reported peer involvement. Age differences were modest and varied among measures and samples. The samples also differed in the magnitude of perceived pressures and conformity dispositions as well as in the degree to which these variables were associated with self-reported behavior. It is concluded that the findings reveal a complexity in adolescent conformity that bears elaboration in future research. (31 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Little research has examined the extent to which these findings apply in other countries or whether the role of significant others varies according to the organization of national educational systems. This article examines the effects of peers' and parents' attitudes regarding academic performance on students' educational aspirations in 12 countries. The results indicate that peers and parents influence educational aspirations in countries with relatively undifferentiated secondary schooling, like the United States, while the influence of significant others is negligible in societies with more differentiated secondary education. In these latter systems, it appears that aspirations are largely determined by the type of school the student attends; there is little room for interpersonal affects. The effects of significant others on students' aspirations depend, in large part, on the structural features of the educational systems in which they operate.}

Despite its quick growth, the conceptualization of PSM is unclear. PSM has been defined in 23 ways with 42 different measures (Bozeman \& Su, 2015; Prebble, 2014). In addition, values, beliefs and attitudes are mixed with existing PSM definitions, making PSM less likely a motivation. To study PSM in the future, scholars should focus on the literal meaning of PSM: ``motivations for public service behaviors.'' As public service behaviors are not a single category, scholars may want to develop multiple tools of measurement tailored for different public service behaviors. Self-determination theory (SDT), we suggest, can be more widely applied.}

Across three experiments our research fails to confirm the relationship between PSM and ethics. We measured ethics both attitudinally and observationally. We conclude that even if the null findings are due to sample characteristics or weaknesses in the priming intervention, the three studies reported here raise concerns regarding the ease with which one can influence behavior by ``priming'' PSM.

Our findings indicate that PSM, measured in dimensional form, is a moderate indicator of an individual?s sector preference: as PSM increases (particularly, the Self-Sacrifice dimension), the attractiveness of working in the public and nonprofit sector, relative to the for-profit sector, also increases. Focusing on a preservice sample of undergraduate students allows us to conclude that PSM is a need people have prior to entering the workplace, and it may indeed drive whether an individual works in the government, nonprofit, or for-profit sector.}

Data from the National Administrative Studies Project, consisting of mail surveys of managers engaged in information management activities working in state-level primary health and human service agencies, is used (n = 274; response rate = 53\%). Results indicate good support for the shortened scale compared to Perry's original work. Findings corroborate Perry's theorized dimensions and items in the exploratory instrument.

There is also evidence that public-service motivation in the federal sector is positively related to organizational commitment. In contrast, there is no evidence that public-policy attitudes vary between those who are and those who are not public service oriented.}

This concept of needs leads to the hypotheses that different regulatory processes underlying goal pursuits are differentially associated with effective functioning and well-being and also that different goal contents have different relations to the quality of behavior and mental health, specifically because different regulatory processes and different goal contents are associated with differing degrees of need satisfaction. Social contexts and individual differences that support satisfaction of the basic needs facilitate natural growth processes including intrinsically motivated behavior and integration of extrinsic motivations, whereas those that forestall autonomy, competence, or relatedness are associated with poorer motivation, performance, and well-being.

Socalled principal-agent models of bureaucratic behavior have considerable value. But they are far better at explaining why bureaucrats shirk (goof off on the job), subvert (commit acts of administrative malfeasance), or steal (use public office for private gain) than they are at explaining why bureaucrats behave as ``principled agents''\textemdash workers who do not shirk, subvert, or steal on the job even when the pecuniary and other tangible incentives to refrain from these behaviors are weak or nonexistent. These workers also often perform thankless tasks, go above and beyond the call of duty, and make virtual gifts of their labor even when the rewards for behaving that way are highly uncertain at best. This article explores the cultural basis of behavior in one government agency, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Together with what is known about other strong-culture government agencies, the case of the BOP argues for the efficacy of social, moral, and symbolic incentives in shaping bureaucratic behavior. Rational choice theorists who discount the possibility of publicspirited bureaucratic behavior are wrong, as are any who deny the capacity of agency leaders to create and sustain organizational cultures of principled agents. Future research should explore the general political, administrative, legal, and budgetary conditions under which organizational cultures of principled agents arise, persist, and change.}

This relationship is moderated by the behavior of other group members: high-PSM people act even more prosocially when the other members of the group show prosocial behavior as well, but they do not do so if the behavior of other group members is not prosocial.},

Using British longitudinal data, we find that individuals are attracted to the public sector by the intrinsic rather than the extrinsic rewards that the sector offers. We also find evidence supporting the intrinsic motivation crowding out hypothesis, in that, higher extrinsic rewards reduce the propensity of intrinsically motivated individuals to accept public sector employment. This is, however, only true for two segments of the UK public sector: the higher education sector and the National Health Service. Although our findings inform the literature on public service motivation, they also pose the question whether lower extrinsic rewards could increase the average quality of job matches in the public sector, thus improving performance without the need for high-powered incentives.},

  abstract = {In this article we examine how social capital affects the creation of human capital. Specifically, we study how college students' peers affect academic performance. Building on existing research, we consider the different types of peers in the academic context and the various mechanisms through which peers affect performance. We test our model using data from an engineering college in India. Our data include information about the performance of individual students as well as their randomly assigned roommates, chosen friends, and chosen study-partners. We find that students with able roommates perform better, and the magnitude of this roommate effect increases when the roommate's skills match the student's academic goals. We also find that students benefit equally from same-and different-caste roommates, suggesting that social similarity does not strengthen peer effects. Finally, although we do not find strong evidence for independent friendship or study-partner effects, our results suggest that roommates become study-partners, and in so doing, affect performance. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that peer effects are a consequential determinant of academic achievement.}

Formal schooling is one possible determinant of PSM. Using longitudinal data, this study analyzes the effects of civics courses and school-based community service in high school on PSM-related values. A propensity score matching strategy that compares observationally similar individuals finds that participation in school-based service activities for credit increases students' reported prosocial values, such as helping others in the community, one underlying component of PSM-related values. However, taking a civics course does not affect PSM or associated values. The results suggest that PSM-related values are malleable and responsive to early service experiences. The values underlying PSM may evolve over time. That is, the development of prosocial values in adolescence may lead to the future development of other values important to PSM.},

The findings, based on 28 separate studies, show no evidence of publication bias and support the positive relationship between PSM and job satisfaction. Furthermore, the results support the importance of providing individuals with the opportunity to serve the public within this relationship.

Utilizing data from the General Social Survey, Public-and private-sector workers are compared with regard to the incentives that they value most highly in a job. This study contributes to the research literature in the difference between public and private employees by providing a multivariate analysis of survey data collected using a national sampling frame. Logistic regression results indicate that public employees are more likely to place a higher value on the intrinsic reward of work that is important and provides a feeling of accomplishment. Additionally, private-sector workers are more likely to place a higher value on such extrinsic reward motivators as high income and short work hours. These findings suggest that public-service motivation does exist.Individuals employed in public organizations value different motives than those employed in private organizations.}

There are several dimensions of status (social, intellectual, etc.). The genesis of status, satisfaction with it, the role of it in behavior, and thoughts about it were surveyed. A self-rating type of scale was then devised and shown to have adequate reliability for 41 cases. In S's use of the scale, the reference group was varied by means of instructions, with resulting shifts in status rating, changes in intercorrelations of the dimensions of status, and changes in reliability of the ratings. Negligible correlations between the ratings and economic radicalism were found. General status is probably a composite of specific statuses.

Researchers seek to study not only whether one variable affects another but also how such a causal relationship arises. Yet commonly used statistical methods for identifying causal mechanisms rely upon untestable assumptions and are often inappropriate even under those assumptions. Randomizing treatment and intermediate variables is also insufficient. Despite these difficulties, the study of causal mechanisms is too important to abandon. We make three contributions to improve research on causal mechanisms. First, we present a minimum set of assumptions required under standard designs of experimental and observational studies and develop a general algorithm for estimating causal mediation effects. Second, we provide a method for assessing the sensitivity of conclusions to potential violations of a key assumption. Third, we offer alternative research designs for identifying causal mechanisms under weaker assumptions. The proposed approach is illustrated using media framing experiments and incumbency advantage studies.},

It shows that leadership experience, volunteering satisfaction, peer collaboration, and constructive self-assessment on achievement in high school Social Studies courses have positive influences on graduates' PSM. This study provides support for the institutional perspective that PSM can be cultivated through processes of institutional socialization, and suggests that the self-determination theory and the social interdependence theory are useful for understanding the effects of extracurricular activities and peer collaboration on PSM, and that collaborative learning and service-learning will be valuable in cultivating PSM.},

Although some important steps have been taken to both improve and internationalize the PSM scale, this work has been done incrementally. In contrast, this study takes a more systematic and comprehensive approach by combining the efforts of international PSM scholars to develop and then test a revised measurement instrument for PSM in 12 countries. Although the resulting four dimensional 16-item measure of PSM reported here provides a better theoretical and empirical foundation for the measurement of PSM, our results suggest that the exact meaning and scaling of PSM dimensions are likely to differ across cultures and languages. These results raise serious concerns regarding the ability to develop a single universal scale of PSM, or making direct comparisons of PSM across countries.},

Public service motives, according to this review, are based on self-sacrifice and fall into three categories: instrumental, value-based, and identification. The dimensions of the public service motivation construct are refined along the lines of attraction to public participation, commitment to public values, compassion, and self-sacrifice. Researchers are urged to include all of its dimensions within their empirical studies to advance contemporary public service motivation studies.},

However, the question of whether PSM influences or is influenced by employment decisions remains open since previous studies have mostly relied on cross-sectional samples with experienced employees. This article investigates the relationship between PSM and employment sector in pre- and postentry settings using data from a panel of Danish physiotherapy students surveyed before and after their first job in the public or private sector. The analyses show that PSM is relevant for neither attraction to the public sector nor actual sector of employment. This indicates that within a group of professionals, PSM is probably more associated with the nature of the public service work than the sector itself. Conversely, PSM is found to be severely hampered after job entry, which is interpreted as a shock effect. This effect is also moderated by sector, that is, public organizational membership prevents PSM from declining as much as in the private sector. This suggests that if PSM is associated with sector employment, then it is primarily a consequence of the sector affiliation, but in a more complex way than previously assumed.}

Using high-frequency data on worker productivity from a large supermarket chain, we find strong evidence of positive productivity spillovers from the introduction of highly productive personnel into a shift. Worker effort is positively related to the productivity of workers who see him, but not workers who do not see him. Additionally, workers respond more to the presence of coworkers with whom they frequently interact. We conclude that social pressure can partially internalize free-riding externalities that are built into many workplaces.}

The design is based on a simple insight: asking about PSM can render salient PSM-oriented identities of respondents. By randomizing the order of PSM and outcome questions, PSM may be exogenously activated among survey respondents, and the causal effects of this activation assessed. Drawing on this design and a sample of over 5,000 Chilean central government employees\textemdash the largest experimental PSM survey sample to date\textemdash we find that PSM activation enhances willingness to report ethical problems to management. This provides the first experimental evidence that PSM may promote ethical behavioral intent, and suggests that activating public employees' PSM can benefit public sector ethics.},

Whether these studies accumulate comparable knowledge about PSM crucially depends on PSM measurement invariance: that PSM has a similar measurement structure in different national contexts. Yet, large-scale cross-country research to address this conundrum remains scant. Drawing on an original survey of 23,000 public servants in ten countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, our paper addresses this gap. Replicating Kim et al.'s 16-item scale, we find partial metric invariance for the four PSM dimensions in eight countries, but scalar non-invariance. This suggests that results from structural equations about the causes and consequences of PSM may be compared across most countries, yet means of PSM and its dimensions are not generally comparable. PSM research thus cannot adjudicate in which countries public service motivation is higher or lower on average but can compare relationships between PSM and individual characteristics or management practices between countries. Our findings underscore the cross-cultural basis of public service motivation and its limits.},

Altruism research suggests that PSM may also respond, somewhat counterintuitively, to negative experiences. We test this in an experimental study of 456 public employees in which treatment groups were asked to recall negative or positive interactions with citizens, before responding to questions from a widely used scale of PSM. Results suggest that expressed PSM is sensitive to, and in fact increases, in response to both positive and negative experiential primes. We conclude with a discussion of implications of conditionality for our broader understanding of PSM.}

Using a randomized survey experiment with 528 law students, this article shows how low-intensity treatments may activate PSM and how the effect of PSM activation efforts compares with efforts to activate another, less self-determined type of motivation (relating to the need for feelings of self-importance). The findings are robust and suggest that low-intensity efforts to activate PSM have a positive effect on an individual's behavioral inclinations. However, efforts toward the activation of motivation relating to feelings of self-importance appear to engender an effect of similar size.},

However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed.},

Certain assumptions about the relationships between the self-concept and behaviour are presented, followed by a series of theoretical propositions and some research suggestions. The implications of the theory for organizational commitment, collective work behaviour, transformational leadership and symbolic management are briefly discussed.},

The first, reflected in the work of Stryker and colleagues, focuses on the linkages of social structures with identities. The second, reflected in the work of Burke and colleagues, focuses on the internal process of self-verification. In the present paper we review each of these strands and then discuss ways in which the two relate to and complement one another. Each provides a context for the other: the relation of social structures to identities influences the process of self-verification, while the process of self-verification creates and sustains social structures. The paper concludes with examples of potentially useful applications of identity theory to other arenas of social psychology, and with a discussion of challenges that identity theory must meet to provide a clear understanding of the relation between self and society.}

The aim of this chapter is to present an outline of a theory of intergroup conflict and some preliminary data relating to the theory. It begins with a discussion of alternative approaches to intergroup conflict with special attention to the "realistic group conflict theory" (RCT). RCT's relative neglect of the processes underlying the development and maintenance of group identity and the possibly autonomous effects upon the in-group and intergroup behavior is responsible for some inconsistencies between the empirical data and the theory in its "classical" form. In this sense, the theoretical orientation to be outlined in this chapter is intended not to replace RCT, but to supplement it in some respects that seem essential for an adequate social psychology of intergroup conflict\textendash particularly as the understanding of the psychological aspects of social change cannot be achieved without an appropriate analysis of the social psychology of social conflict. The authors argue that people derive a sense of self-worth and social belongingness from their memberships in groups, and so they are motivated to draw favorable comparisons between their own group and other groups.

It is, therefore, necessary to assess the evidential value of the research on a certain effect; that is, one must rule out that it is the result of questionable research practices. We introduce the p-curve method to public administration research and apply it to the research on the relationship between public service motivation (PSM) and individual performance, to demonstrate how the evidential value of a body of published research can be assessed.

Our findings provide tentative behavioral evidence on a linear relationship between PSM and the likelihood of PSRB and a strong positive association with client likeability, which is an asymmetric relationship: Negative affect cues have a larger negative effect than positive affect cues have a positive effect on PSRB. Although our results vary across the three country studies regarding the effects of PSM, overall, the results imply that high-PSM individuals have a tendency to being more likely to engage in PSRB and that clients who are perceived as more favorable will receive a less strict application of bureaucratic rules compared to less favorable clients.}

Public service motivation (PSM), a concept proposed back in 1990 as a major research theme in public administration, is a typical form of prosocial motivation and it literally refers to ``the motivation to serve the public''. Literature reveals that PSM is limited within the scope of altruism, which in our view is quite misleading. Prosocial behavior does not have to be driven by altruistic motives. For example, many high-ranking public officials make public policies simply due to media pressure or public scrutiny. Therefore, we use the motivational typology in self-determination theory (SDT) to explore the egoistic side of PSM. From our research findings, we propose and argue that it is unlikely that there is a universal measurement tool for PSM. Scholars need to first identify a given public service behavior, then develop measures to test intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, and external regulation respectively.}

Although the role of trait anger in cyberbullying perpetration has attracted attention in the research literature, it is unclear the temporal sequence between trait anger and adolescents' cyberbullying perpetration and whether stressful environments could interact synergistically with trait anger to create a profile of the particularly severe risk to adolescents' cyberbullying perpetration. This study contributed to existing knowledge by examining the longitudinal and reciprocal relationships between trait anger and cyberbullying perpetration and exploring whether peer pressure and family economic stress would moderate these relationships across 2 years (3 time points) with a cohort of Chinese adolescents ( N = 2,407, M age = 12.75 at baseline). The cross-lagged model revealed that prior trait anger was associated with later self-reported cyberbullying perpetration ({$\beta$} T1 \textrightarrow{} T2 = 0.09 and {$\beta$} T2 \textrightarrow{} T3 = 0.10), whereas earlier self-reported cyberbullying perpetration was not associated with subsequent trait anger. Peer pressure moderated the link between trait anger and self-reported cyberbullying perpetration. Family economic stress did not play a moderating role in the link between trait anger and self-reported cyberbullying perpetration. Findings suggest that cyberbullying perpetration prevention and intervention programs should attach importance to adolescents' trait anger and the way of getting along with their peers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract) This study demonstrates a striking interaction between trait anger and peer pressure in adolescents' cyberbullying perpetration. Findings provide further support regarding the importance of trait anger and peer pressure in preventing adolescent cyberbullying perpetration. Additionally, results indicate that more attention must be provided to reduce anger and peer pressure during middle school. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},
